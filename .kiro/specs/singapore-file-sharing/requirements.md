# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Singapore-compliant file sharing application. The application will be built as a cloud-native solution on AWS using React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and Terraform for infrastructure as code. The system emphasizes compliance, security, and audit capabilities suitable for Singapore's regulatory environment, with integrated notification systems for file sharing and access monitoring.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely authenticate using AWS Cognito, so that I can access the file sharing platform with proper identity verification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL present a login interface powered by AWS Cognito
2. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL grant access to the file sharing interface
3. WHEN a user fails authentication THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt
4. WHEN a user session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect to the login page
5. IF a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL prevent access to any file operations

### Requirement 2: File Upload and Storage

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to upload files securely to AWS S3, so that I can share documents while maintaining compliance with Singapore data protection standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a file for upload THEN the system SHALL validate file type and size constraints
2. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL store it in AWS S3 with server-side encryption
3. WHEN a file upload completes THEN the system SHALL generate a unique file identifier and metadata record
4. IF a file upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging and retry options
5. WHEN a file is stored THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate S3 bucket policies for Singapore compliance

### Requirement 3: File Sharing and Access Control

**User Story:** As a file owner, I want to control who can access my shared files, so that I can maintain proper data governance and privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user shares a file THEN the system SHALL generate a secure, time-limited sharing link
2. WHEN a sharing link is accessed THEN the system SHALL verify permissions before allowing download
3. WHEN a file is shared THEN the system SHALL record the sharing event in the audit trail
4. IF a sharing link expires THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt
5. WHEN file permissions are modified THEN the system SHALL update access controls immediately

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Audit Trail

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to view a complete audit trail of all file operations, so that I can ensure regulatory compliance and investigate security incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any file operation occurs THEN the system SHALL log the event with timestamp, user, action, and file details
2. WHEN an audit log is created THEN the system SHALL store it in AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch
3. WHEN audit logs are queried THEN the system SHALL provide searchable and filterable results
4. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and notifications
5. IF audit logs are accessed THEN the system SHALL record who accessed the logs and when

### Requirement 5: Singapore Compliance Framework

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated compliance monitoring using AWS Config, so that I can ensure the system meets Singapore's data protection and security requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN AWS Config SHALL monitor all resources for compliance rules
2. WHEN a compliance violation is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically remediate where possible
3. WHEN compliance status changes THEN the system SHALL notify administrators immediately
4. WHEN compliance reports are generated THEN they SHALL include Singapore-specific regulatory requirements
5. IF manual remediation is required THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance and documentation

### Requirement 6: Infrastructure as Code

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all infrastructure defined in Terraform, so that I can deploy the system consistently and maintain version control over infrastructure changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN infrastructure is provisioned THEN Terraform SHALL create all AWS resources from code
2. WHEN infrastructure changes are made THEN they SHALL be version controlled and peer reviewed
3. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL follow AWS Well-Architected Framework principles
4. WHEN resources are created THEN they SHALL include appropriate tags for cost management and compliance
5. IF infrastructure drift occurs THEN the system SHALL detect and alert on configuration changes

### Requirement 7: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As an end user, I want an intuitive React-based interface, so that I can easily upload, manage, and share files without technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the interface SHALL be responsive and accessible
2. WHEN file operations are performed THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress feedback
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL display the user's files and sharing status clearly
5. IF the user is on a mobile device THEN the interface SHALL adapt appropriately

### Requirement 8: Email and SNS Notifications

**User Story:** As a file owner, I want to receive notifications when my files are shared or downloaded, so that I can monitor file access and maintain awareness of data usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is shared via email THEN the system SHALL send an email notification to specified recipients with secure access links
2. WHEN a file is downloaded THEN the system SHALL send an SNS notification to the file owner
3. WHEN email notifications are sent THEN they SHALL include file metadata, expiration details, and security warnings
4. WHEN SNS notifications are triggered THEN they SHALL contain download timestamp, user identity, and file information
5. IF notification delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry and log the failure for audit purposes

### Requirement 9: Data Security and Encryption

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want all data encrypted in transit and at rest, so that my sensitive information remains protected according to Singapore standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use TLS 1.2 or higher encryption
2. WHEN files are stored in S3 THEN they SHALL be encrypted using AWS KMS
3. WHEN database records are created THEN they SHALL be encrypted at rest
4. WHEN encryption keys are managed THEN they SHALL follow AWS key rotation policies
5. IF encryption fails THEN the system SHALL prevent data storage and alert administrators

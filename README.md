# TraceShare - Secure File Sharing with Complete Audit Trails

> **An internal file sharing tool for companies built on AWS. Share files quickly and securely through custom links with full traceability and visibility for every action. Built cloud native for modern teams.**

## What TraceShare Offers

**‚ö° Lightning Fast** - Log in, upload a file, and generate a link within seconds  
**üîí Secure File Sharing** - Direct-to-S3 uploads using presigned URLs with restricted access  
**üìä Complete Audit Trails** - Every upload, download, and share is tracked with timestamp and location  
**üõ°Ô∏è Security & Privacy** - Authentication with MFA, encryption at rest and in transit, all data in Singapore (ap-southeast-1)  
**‚òÅÔ∏è Serverless Architecture** - Built on AWS Lambda, API Gateway and other AWS services for automatic scaling and cost efficiency

## About This Project

This is a **security-focused learning project** where I explore cloud security concepts through building a production-quality file sharing application. While functional and feature-complete, it serves as my hands-on laboratory for implementing AWS security best practices, compliance considerations, and serverless architecture patterns.

**Note:** This is a personal learning project, not production software. It's my sandbox for experimenting with security concepts while building something genuinely useful.

## Project Motivation

As a fresh graduate looking to deepen my understanding of cloud security, I wanted to build something that would challenge me to implement:
- **Authentication & Authorization** patterns in the cloud
- **Data encryption** both in transit and at rest
- **Secure file handling** with proper access controls
- **Audit logging** for security monitoring
- **Infrastructure as Code** for reproducible deployments
- **Basic compliance considerations** under Singapore's context

## Architecture

**Serverless & Cloud-Native Design:**
- **Frontend**: React SPA with TypeScript, hosted on CloudFront CDN
- **Backend**: Node.js Lambda functions with API Gateway
- **Database**: DynamoDB with streams for real-time audit logging
- **Storage**: S3 with KMS encryption and lifecycle policies
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito User Pools and Identity Pools
- **Notifications**: SES for email sharing, SNS for download alerts
- **Compliance**: AWS Config rules for automated compliance scoring
- **Infrastructure**: 100% Terraform-managed infrastructure as code

## Learning Goals & Development Methodology

### My Development Approach
1. **Spec-Driven Development**: Using Kiro AI to generate detailed requirements and act as my project manager
2. **Console-First Implementation**: Building and testing features manually to make sure I understand what I am building
3. **Infrastructure as Code**: Writing Terraform to codify and automate the manual configurations after that
4. **Iterative Security Hardening**: Starting with basic functionality, then layering in security controls

### Security Concepts I'm Exploring
- **Authentication & Authorization**: AWS Cognito integration with JWT tokens
- **Data Encryption**: Learning KMS for encryption at rest and TLS for transit
- **Access Controls**: Implementing least-privilege IAM policies and presigned URLs
- **Audit Logging**: Building comprehensive logging for security monitoring
- **Secure File Handling**: Understanding secure upload/download patterns

### Compliance Learning (Singapore Focus)
- **PDPA Basics**: Understanding Personal Data Protection Act requirements
- **Data Residency**: Keeping data within Singapore region (ap-southeast-1)
- **Audit Trails**: Learning what needs to be logged for compliance
- **User Rights**: Implementing basic data access and deletion capabilities

## What I'm Building

### Core Features (Learning Focus)
- **File Upload/Download**: Practicing secure file handling with S3 presigned URLs
- **User Authentication**: Implementing AWS Cognito for login/signup flows
- **Access Controls**: Learning to implement proper file permissions
- **Audit Logging**: Building comprehensive activity tracking

## Tech Stack (What I'm Learning With)

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript (getting comfortable with modern React)
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling (learning utility-first CSS)
- **AWS Cognito SDK** for authentication (no Amplify - doing it manually to learn)
- **Vite** for build tooling

### Backend (Planned)
- **Node.js 18** Lambda functions (first time with serverless)
- **API Gateway** REST API (learning API design)
- **DynamoDB** with streams (NoSQL database practice)
- **S3** with presigned URLs (secure file handling)

### Infrastructure
- **Terraform** for infrastructure as code (learning IaC principles)
- **AWS Provider** with Singapore region
- **Modular approach** (trying to write reusable code)

## What I Want to Learn About Monitoring

Future learning goals for observability:
- **CloudWatch Basics**: Understanding logs and basic metrics
- **Simple Dashboards**: Creating basic monitoring views
- **Alerting**: Setting up notifications for errors
- **Cost Monitoring**: Keeping track of AWS spending
- **Security Monitoring**: Learning what security events to watch for
